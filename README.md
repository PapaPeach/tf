## This is meant as a reference only! Dragging & dropping this into your tf folder will overwrite your settings with my own!
This contains my tf folder with all the configurations for the mods I use.  
It does **not** included the mods themselves, such as MasterComfig or Horsie's Viewmodel Editor. You should download those from the creator and steal my settings if you so desire.
